scdm â€” The Simple Console Display Manager
==========================================

[![tests on branch master](https://img.shields.io/travis/jorsn/scdm/master.svg?label=tests%20on%20branch%20master)](https://travis-ci.org/jorsn/scdm)

**scdm** is a login manager for the console, a bit like
[CDM] but simpler. It can be used instead of DM's like xdm, kdm etc. to
choose and start terminal or X11 sessions.

Installation
------------

### Nix

Ad-hoc installation:

    $ nix-env -if https://github.com/jorsn/scdm/archive/<tag/commit>.tar.gz

For a declarative installation you can include the following line in a location
where you define packages, e.g. in an overlay like this:

```nix
self: super:

{
    scdm = import (builtins.fetchTarball
        https://github.com/jorsn/scdm/archive/nix.tar.gz)
        { pkgs = super; };
}
```

### Gentoo

An ebuild is available in [this overlay](https://github.com/jorsn/jorsn-gentoo).


### Other *nixes

* Type `make install`. The default installation `prefix` is `/usr/local`.
* Or create a package for your distribution, publish and install this
  and tell me about it, e.g. via a pull request or just an email to
  johannes.rosenberger (at) jorsn.eu.


Configuration & Invocation
---------------------------

The configuration is almost self-explaining. It is documented in
the example scdmrc.

To run **scdm**, use

    $ scdm <rcfile>

**scdm** tries to source configuration files in this order, and uses the first
existing one:

    <rcfile specified on command line>
    $HOME/.scdmrc
    /etc/scdmrc

To autostart **scdm** when you log in your account, copy the content of
`/usr/share/doc/scdm/profile.sh` to the tail of your shell profile (`~/.profile`,
etc.) or copy the file to `/etc/profile.d/` and make sure it is sourced after
everything else, e.g. name the file `1000-scdm.sh` (because it uses exec).

If you are using NixOS, you may want to append it to `environment.loginShellInit`
in your `configuration.nix`.


Bugs & Enhancements
-------------------

If you encounter any bugs or have ideas for enhancements, please send me an email or
create an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/jorsn/scdm/issues).

Dependencies
-------------

**scdm** only depends on:

* a posix compliant shell (with utils)
* `fgconsole`, which is provided by [busybox](https://busybox.net/)
   or the [linux keyboard tools](http://kbd-project.org/)
* the coreutils
* `startx(1)` if you want to start X11 sessions

The first two points are fully covered by busybox.
