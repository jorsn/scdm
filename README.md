scdm â€” The Simple Console Display Manager
=======================================

**scdm** is a console display manager a bit like [CDM] but simpler.
It can be used instead of DM's like xdm, kdm etc.

Invocation
----------------

To run **scdm**, use

    $ scdm <rcfile>

**scdm** tries to source configuration files in this order, and uses the first
existing one:

    <rcfile specified on command line>
    $HOME/.cdmrc
    /etc/cdmrc

To autostart **scdm** when you log in your account, copy the content of
`/usr/share/doc/scdm/profile.sh` to the tail of your shell profile (`~/.profile`,
etc.) or copy the file to `/etc/profile.d/scdm.sh`.
